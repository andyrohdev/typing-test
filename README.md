# Brainstorming Design

Typing test word design

I REALLY WANT TO ADD A COMBO SYSTEM LIKE A RHYTHM GAME! THAT WOULD BE COOL
Combo breaks when you make a spelling mistake or take too long, the timer window gets smaller the higher your combo, caps at a limit (Donâ€™t want to make it impossible)
Maybe make it like a story game like progression and add a endless mode as optional game mode for score breaking / record setting.

File reader reads from database popular quotes that the user will type.

Text object
	Length
	Should it be the files nextline?
	

Timer object

Application will show the user some choices.
	These choices will help the user decide what kind of test they want to do.

First UI.

Start typing test
		Easy
		All lowercase, no proper punctuation
		Medium

		Hard

Settings
